		"executiveSummary": "The No Surprises Act (NSA) reshaped the landscape of reimbursement. Patients are now shielded from unexpected out-of-network bills, but providers face a new challenge: securing fair payment from payers. To address this, Congress created Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) — an arbitration mechanism designed to resolve disputes between providers and insurers. IDR offers providers the ability to secure fairer reimbursement, often several times higher than the initial payer offer. Yet most providers are not taking advantage. Only about 10% of eligible claims are pursued through IDR. That means 90% of claims — billions of dollars in potential revenue — are left on the table each year.

		"year": "2025",
		"executiveSummary": "In January 2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will implement a new prior authorization initiative called WISeR (Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction). The program will launch in six states, Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Washington, Ohio, and New Jersey; with the potential for broader national expansion in the future. WISeR is not just another regulatory update, it’s a paradigm shift in how outpatient procedures for Medicare patients are authorized and reimbursed. High-volume services, including many common orthopedic and radiology interventions, will soon require mandatory, pre-service approval. This white paper outlines: The objectives and scope of WISeR; The implications for orthopedic and radiology practices; The risks of continuing with manual prior authorization processes; How ImagineSoftware helps future-proof your workflows with scalable, intelligent automation.",

These procedures are routinely scheduled by orthopedists and radiologists, and they’ll soon be flagged for prior authorization every time for Medicare patients in WISeR states.",

				"content": "Most practices today use fax-based workflows, depend on manual payer lookups, rely on email, spreadsheets, or sticky notes to track authorization status, and face delays in scheduling, high denial rates, and staff burnout. WISeR introduces more than administrative tasks. It exposes underlying inefficiencies in how many practices handle payer requirements. This model may have survived until now—but it cannot scale under WISeR.",

Organizations that proactively adopt technology and redesign processes will increase throughput without adding staff, improve financial performance by reducing denials, accelerate care delivery by eliminating PA delays, and enhance patient satisfaction through faster scheduling and fewer disruptions.

		"keyTakeaways": "WISeR is a wake-up call. The healthcare system is shifting, toward greater oversight, tighter margins, and more pressure to deliver seamless care. WISeR reflects all of that. It’s not just a CMS pilot; it’s a preview of what’s to come. Now is the time to build the foundation you’ll need for the future."
